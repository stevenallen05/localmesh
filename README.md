# Tensorwave take-home

> A reference implementation of the **microservice-template + service-catalogue**
> deployment pattern, demonstrated through a small Rust + Next.js metrics service.

The take-home asked for a metrics monitoring system. The artifact here is
*one team's microservice repo* shaped the way an organization's CI/CD core
should support it: a top-level `docker-compose.yml` that `include:`s an
observability module from a stub service catalogue. Helm charts are
generated from compose, not hand-maintained.

## Read these first

Stakeholder-facing context — read these regardless of role:

- [`docs/stakeholder/ENGINEERING_RULES.md`](./docs/stakeholder/ENGINEERING_RULES.md) —
  the design rules tied to business needs. Read these to understand the *why*.
- [`docs/stakeholder/PROJECT_SCOPE.md`](./docs/stakeholder/PROJECT_SCOPE.md) —
  the boundary between what this take-home actually ships and what a
  production deployment would assume.
- [`docs/stakeholder/PRODUCTION_DISCUSSIONS.md`](./docs/stakeholder/PRODUCTION_DISCUSSIONS.md) —
  the **discovery framework** for a real prod engagement, sized by the
  complexity of your business.
- [`docs/stakeholder/PRODUCTION_DECISION_MATRIX.md`](./docs/stakeholder/PRODUCTION_DECISION_MATRIX.md) —
  empty research scaffold for evaluating candidate solutions to each of
  those decisions (3-star ratings × ≤7 dimensions).
- [`docs/stakeholder/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](./docs/stakeholder/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) —
  current state of every design choice, one row each (dev choice,
  rationale, production-considerations signposts).

Engineering-side material (code-facing implementation rules):

- [`docs/engineering/rules/`](./docs/engineering/rules/) — stack-specific
  style notes for Rust and the compose→Helm tool (katenary).

## All project documentation

- [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md) — original take-home requirements (read-only reference).
- [`docs/stakeholder/`](./docs/stakeholder/) — stakeholder-facing documents (rules, scope, discussions, decisions).
- [`docs/engineering/`](./docs/engineering/) — engineer-facing implementation rules.
- [`docs/superpowers/`](./docs/superpowers/) — exploration artifacts, design specs, plans, and other agentic/research material. Detailed technical specs live under `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Run locally

First time only (or after wiping `grafana-data`):

```bash
make setup
```

This forces Grafana's admin password to `admin` and mints a service-account token the Rust server reads on startup. Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
